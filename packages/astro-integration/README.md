# astro-integration-template

This is my opinionated template for creating Astro [integrations](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/integrations-reference/), aimed at the best DX possible.
It's primarily designed for my personal use, but I've made it accessible for anyone interested.
The template comes with:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for installing dependencies and managing a workspace.
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting.
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for CI.
<!-- - [Dependabot version updates](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates) for automatically keeping dependencies up to date. -->

## Setup

1. Create a new repository using this template.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) if you haven't already.
4. Run `bun install` in the root of the repository to install the dependencies.
5. Open `TODO.md` and follow the instructions.
